-> Often errors crop up because of unintentional typos
-> Scanning thousands of lines of code manually is tedious
	- To help with this we have inbuilt utilities in Windoes, Unix and MAC
		- Windows : FC FirstFile SecondFile
					Will show lines in both text files, one below the other only displaying the lines that have changed
		- Unix : diff -U FirstFile SeconFile (need to confrim syntax)
					Uses + and - to show lines that have been added or removed from a given file

-> Variety of text editors are available
	- Text is written in the plain-text-format(sans formatting with just text and line feeds) unlike in Word which uses the rich-text format(formatting data is passed along with plain text)
	- Sublime
	- Notepad++			

Excerice
-> Installed Sublime and git on my PC and used gitBash to launch sublime from the command line	


Question 
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced ?
Answer
By comparing two files you can go over the changes at a glance and get to know if any of the changes were unintentional

Question
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Answer
It would help me save time by helping me rollback to prevously working versions of code, in case of any mishap

Question
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Answer
Pros - You would have absolute control of when to commit, so the number of commits would not be too high or too less
Cons - You might forget to commit, accidently break the code and be unable to revert

Question
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Answer
If the same change was made across multiple files, it enables us to revert all at once rather than track each file seperately

Question
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Answer
git log - It will list out all the commit with their IDs,timestamp and commits, arranged in order of the commits by default
git diff - git diff <First ID> <Second ID> , It will list out the additions(+ symbol appended) and deletions (- symbol appended)

Question
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Answer
If anything goes wrong I can always revert to a working version of the code

Question
What do you want to try using Git for?
