Question 1
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Answer
After initializing a repository git will start tracking that folder. However you will need to explicitly specify the files that  need to be tracked.

Question 2
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Answer
The staging area stands between the working area and 'committed' area. It helps you to group together files that need to be committed together.
